Nice starting template for command-line SDL/OpenGL/GLSL projects

Based on template outlined at https://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2013/08/15/lesson-0-visual-studio

SDL2.dll must be placed in bin/ folder

Compile stage assumes SDL2 headers at "../../sdl2-2.0.12/include"

Link stage assumes SDL2 static libraries at "../../SDL2-2.0.12/lib"
